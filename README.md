A collection of non-deterministic iterators for Javascript.  Included in the code is a standard implementation of a red-black tree augmented to maintain order statistics.  Please feel free to use, add, comment, etc. on the code.  It is well documented, though I will likely add more information to this readme in the days to come.

For generating random JS types, see `/src/js/rand.js`.

For train-able generators, see `/src/stats/markov.js`.


## Todo:

- ~~Implment standard red-black tree for order statistics.~~
- ~~Implement basic discrete probability distribution (PD) class.~~
- ~~Implement basic Markov process class(es).~~
- ~~Setup gulp for testing and documentation.~~
- ~~Documentation.~~
- Finish base (Mocha) tests.
- Support discrete PDs with infinite outcomes.
- Implement generators for well known discrete PDs.
- Support continuous PDs.
- Implement generators for well known continuous PDs.
